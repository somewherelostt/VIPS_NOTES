# College Notes Repository

Welcome to my **College Notes** repository! 🎓 This is a personal collection of notes, organized by semester and subject, that I have compiled throughout my college journey. The goal of this repository is to keep my notes well-organized and easily accessible for future reference.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository will be structured by semesters and subjects. For now, as the current semester is ending, there is only one folder for this semester:

```
📦 College-Notes/
 └── 📂 Semester-X/   # Replace 'X' with your current semester
     └── 📂 Subject-Name/   # Name of the subject (e.g., Data Structures, AI)
         ├── Topic1.md      # Notes for Topic 1
         ├── Topic2.md      # Notes for Topic 2
         └── ...
```

As I progress, I will continue to update this repository with notes from future semesters and subjects.

## 📘 Current Semester

**Semester X** (e.g., 6th Semester, replace accordingly):

- **Subject**: [Subject Name] (e.g., Data Structures, replace accordingly)

The notes for this semester are structured by topics, covering key concepts, solved examples, and important highlights.

## 📜 Usage

Feel free to browse and use these notes for:

- Quick revision before exams 📚
- Clarifying concepts 🤔
- Preparing for competitive exams 🎯

However, please note that these are personal notes and might not cover every detail from the course material. Always refer to your textbooks and class lectures for comprehensive learning.
